- use "git clone https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs506/fa2023/t_03/java-education-tool.git"
- enter your credentials
- you should now have the repository on your local!

# HOW TO RUN THE APP

# FULLSTACK

I have created ~~test~~ code that demonstrates we can communicate between all the seperate pieces. This can be found in ~/backend_eddie/spring-boot-stuff/.
The example I followed is from this link: https://youtu.be/4LZKnegAm4g?si=Zlx8Ug7zYRSoZBlq

- open a terminal
- tunnel into the team's container (I USED: ~~ssh -L localhost:33306:localhost:33306 zachc@cs506-team-03.cs.wisc.edu)~~
- Updated command for newest: ssh -L localhost:13306:localhost:13306 zachc@cs506-team-03.cs.wisc.edu
- launch the main file in ~/backend_eddie/spring-boot-stuff/JavaEducator/src/main/java../JavaEducatorApplication.java (~~I USED ECLIPSE IDE TO LAUNCH IT~~)
- NOTE: You can run this from VSCODE! Check this out: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-spring-boot
- you should now be able to use the testing and login page on the frontend
